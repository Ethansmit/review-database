# Project Overview
Here I will define some basic goals and visions about this project before implementation. I will outline my thought 
process and investigation into this project in this document. Note that the ideas written here are subject to change 
and that many of the goals outlined here are before the actual implementation of the project. This document contains
a simple project outline before implementation. (EDIT THIS LATER)

## Defining The Problem
**Project Idea:**

There are various ways to store your reviews about different medias. If I watch a movie, I can log it in my LetterBox. 
If I listen to a new album, I can log in my RateYourMusic account. If I eat at a new restaraunt, I can write a Google
Review about it. But, notice the need for an account for every single hobby you want to enjoy. The main goal of this 
project is to provide a single application which will store all of this information quickly and easily. It will store 
various reviews and information, as much or little as wanted, about the mediums, and provide a very easy way to relate 
information about different mediums, like movies and tv shows, to each other. This will provide a simple way for 
hobbyists to catalogue, write down reviews or notes, and do all of this efficently and with a simple interface.

This project is mostly for myself, or whoever wants to utilize it. This application will be an offline project, so
the reviews and catalogued medias will not be public, and for personal observation.

**Problem:**

The specific problem I want to tackle is to ***centralize all my reviews into a single application***. This application 
will tackle the challenge of centralizing these reviews and make the process of reviewing quick and easy. I can 
cataloguea variety of data about the media and quickly compare information. I want to outline here that the problem I am 
tacklingfirst and foremost is not the issue of making my reviews public, this is only a side-effect from the original 
method. Such a feature would be a side objective to the main problem.

**Expected Outcomes:**

The main outcome of the project is to have a simple application that will mainly do two things. Provide an easy means of 
logging reviews about any given media and allow me to manipulate my reviews to see specific things I want, like what movies 
I saw between date 1 and date 2, or what highest rated video games are. These will be the main functionality from the 
application, but possibly other ideas will be implemented later.

**End Goal**

The main goal is to finish this application and automate an important aspect of my hobbys. I also seek to expand upon 
this project so that anyone is capable of downloading and using it. Another end goal is to possibly make it compatible 
with various review sites, so that when a review isstored in this application, it will insert the same review 
information to that website. This finalgoal is not necessary, but it would be a nice addition to only need to input my 
review once and it would be placed across all my review sites.
