# Project Design
Here I will define some design goals and visions
about the project.

## Initial Design
#### Though Process
The project will focus on implementing a
series of functions which will connect
the front-end and its inputs with a database.
The database will hence have an API which will
interact with the backend. The backend will be
various tables which will store the data,
and the API will be the central functionality of
the entire system. Then, the frontend will be
both a website and an application, both of which
can interact with the database and perform 
insertions, deletion, and modification.
